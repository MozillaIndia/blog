<blockquote><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <a href="http://blogmozillaindiaorg.wpengine.mcws.mozilla.community/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/07/Mozilla-India-Planning-Meetup-2016.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1718" src="https://blogmozillaindiaorg.wpengine.mcws.mozilla.community/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/07/Mozilla-India-Planning-Meetup-2016.jpg" alt="Mozilla-India-Planning-Meetup-2016" width="1200" height="627" /></a></span><em>&ldquo;Coming Together is the Beginning, Staying together is the progress and working together is the Success.&rdquo;</em></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A team of initiators joined to put forth the future into the present as a plan. A team of 25 members, selected gems from various sub-communities represented their crew by their presence in the Mozilla India Planning Meetup - 2016 at Pune on 09th &amp; 10th of July 2016. The team had also invited George Roter, Head of Core Contributors, Participation at Mozilla to support them in their journey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the energy being widespread the Day 1 had marked its beginning.</span></p>
<h2>Day 1</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspiration, the only thing which kindles the inner spirit of every human. The first session of the meetup was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stories of Self</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted by Haiyya. A well-organised presentation of one's life, i.e., the experience we share can be the best rope of hope to all those who listen to it.<br />
</span></p>
<h3>Future vision of Mozilla</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Future goals of Mozilla were the theme of the next session. &nbsp;The goals focus on five important areas </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Context Graph and other Test Pilot features in Firefox</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Future of Rust and Servo</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connected Devices</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mozilla&rsquo;s Issues Agenda and Advocacy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mozilla Leadership Network</span></li>
</ol>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">1] Context Graph</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Context Graph is a recommendation system for the Web. Searching content in the search bar won&rsquo;t just limit the results based on the browsing history but will also explore documents and links corresponding to the search, based on metadata of all web pages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Activity stream is the first Context Graph feature, currently available in <a href="https://testpilot.firefox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Test Pilot</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It will evolve into a search engine which will also help the users to discover places on the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web, they have</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> never seen. It would be available for both desktop and mobile platforms.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">2] Future of Rust and Servo</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mozilla Research is supporting a new system programming language called Rust since 2009. This language concentrates on three crucial necessities - safety, speed and concurrency. Rust is one of the key focus areas, and it aims to provide a better platform for programmers in writing efficient codes with a comfortable level of abstraction. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, Servo - the parallel browser engine project is under trial. It is a modern, high-performance engine designed for both application and embedded use. It is written in the new system programming language - Rust. This project aims to achieve better parallelism, security, modularity, and performance. To know more about Servo, check- </span><a href="https://servo.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://servo.org/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">3] Connected Devices</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mozilla wants to create open and accessible platforms that will allow individuals, businesses and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">others to benefit from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Internet of Things(IoT)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &nbsp;IoT leads the way to the next phase of the Internet. The IoT ideas that align with Mozilla&rsquo;s goals would be selected, and their problem statement and solutions would be worked on. Later, the prototypes of such statements would be built and would be tested in the market. Depending on the market response, the production of such devices would begin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the outcome of the overall process would be defining platforms.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">4] Mozilla&rsquo;s Issue Agenda and Advocacy</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mozilla has identified five issues that must be tackled in the current era, to build an Open Internet:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open privacy and security</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open innovation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decentralization</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web-literacy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital inclusion</span></li>
</ol>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mozilla Advocacy Engine:</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A global movement to build and protect the next wave of openness and opportunity online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The near-term goals are Online Privacy and Encryption whereas the mid-term goals are to increase the influence on issues like privacy, digital inclusion and web literacy.The long-term goals were set as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">behaviour</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> change and policy change. The impact of this will be providing conscious choice to build and protect Open Internet and launch of products, policies and laws in support of the Open Internet.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">5] Mozilla Leadership Network</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mozilla Leadership Network is a global network of diverse leaders who will ensure the next wave of access, inclusion and opportunity online. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It open practices to shape the Web in new ways and increase influence on privacy, digital inclusion and web literacy. It also supports to improve their skills and experience as leaders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The thematic hubs to be focused are learning, science, internet policy and advocacy, women and web literacy, Internet of Things.</span></p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">MLN audience:</span></h5>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Champion</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executive</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professional</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emerging Leader</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Young Leader</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will generate a high impact on network alignment, network connectivity, network size, member influence and reach.</span></p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discussion on community restructure was the next session.</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Restructuring - the way to fill the gap.This session focused on bringing out the thoughts of participants regarding the structure of the Mozilla India community. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The participants</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were divided into groups and were asked to project their ideas about the structure of the community. The presentation by each team laid the first stone of change. With this brainstorming session, we got an overview, i.e., we paved the foundation.</span></p>
<h2>Day 2</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agenda for the second day focused on two topics, one related to a restructuring of the community structure and the other about the plan for the Meetup 2016.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the foundation we created the day before, we were ready to lay the roads towards reformation.The attendees were divided into various groups and were asked to derive strategies around the following blocks:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Training and Workshops.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Conflict Resolution.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Team building and Recognition.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Planning and Community restructure.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Communication.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The motive of this session was to take into consideration a broader perspective about the functioning of the Mozilla India community and derive strategies around them. The restructuring process is a five weeks plan from 20th July to 21st August. Mozilla India has invited people to suggest the task force structure </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">via <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeH4Vq-iJuDj88T2Lk5vZrm6G7GOIFkRueKU3FitIbNk9Bi_A/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this link</a> before August.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following this, &ldquo;the planning for the Mozilla India Meetup 2016&rdquo; &nbsp;was set to fire.</span></p>
