<p>So, the <a title="Call for Action post" href="http://blogmozillaindiaorg.wpengine.mcws.mozilla.community/875" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first pilot of #mozGeo sprint</a> comes to an end. We are astonished to see how much efforts all the scouts put in to make India quite a bit brighter on the world map of Mozilla Location Service.</p>
