The Mozilla Foundation is a non-profit organization that promotes openness, innovation and participation on the Internet. We promote the values of an <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open Internet</a> to the broader world.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At Mozilla, doing good is part of our code. There are thousands of Mozilla volunteers and staff around the world who believe deeply in our mission and values. Your donation helps us build an Internet that puts the public good over profit. Mozilla conducts a number of activities in support of the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/about/manifesto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mozilla Manifesto</a>.&nbsp;In general, resources are dedicated to promoting openness, innovation and opportunity on the Internet in ways that will benefit everyone.&nbsp;Your donations will not only enable Mozilla to continue current activities that support these goals, but will also allow us to develop new programs that will support the Mozilla community, the open Internet and to increase web literacy.</span></p>
<p>Mozilla is best known for the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox </a> browser, but we advance our mission through other <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/products/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">software projects</a>, <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/grants/">grants</a> and engagement and education efforts such as <a href="https://teach.mozilla.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mozilla Learning</a>.</p>
<p>Mozilla Firefox is built with a mission to put you first, above all else. We do it to keep you in control, so you can browse without worry, and because no one else will. Apart from desktop, Firefox browser is available for <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/android/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a> and <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/ios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a> devices.</p>
<p>The Mozilla Learning Network offers programs and a global community dedicated to helping people learn the most important skills of our age: <em>the ability to read, write and participate in the digital world.</em></p>

<p>Meet Aman, who brings Mozilla's non-profit mission to life. He's making a big impact in his World by teaching people in his Pune community about the Web. Like him, hundreds of volunteers in Mozilla India community spend many hours of their week contributing to Mozilla projects. Their work is supported and encouraged by Mozilla. Donating to Mozilla would be the best way to let them know that you want them to continue doing their inspiring work.</p>
<p><b>Within 10 years there will be five billion citizens of the Web.</b> Mozilla wants all of these people to know what the Web can do. What&rsquo;s possible. We want them to have the agency, tools and know-how they need to unlock the full power of the Web. We want them to use the Web to make their lives better. We want them to know they are citizens of the Web.The Mozilla Foundation's education and public awareness efforts, which span several continents and reach millions of people, are made possible through philanthropic donations.</p>
<p>As a non-profit, we're protecting your rights on the Web and fighting to preserve openness, innovation, and participation on the Internet. If everyone reading this chipped in â‚¹150, we would be supported for another year. Donate now.</p>
