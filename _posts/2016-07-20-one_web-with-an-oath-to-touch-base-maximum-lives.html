<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the heart of hearts, we believe that the Internet is the basic need of the hour and as a citizen of the&nbsp;21st&nbsp;century, everyone must have access to the Internet. While we still have a literacy rate of 74.04% in the country </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and 77.08% in West Bengal,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">there are still a lot of people from various age groups have not used the Internet or do not know how to use it. The Initiative planned in such a way that we can reach out to a maximum number of people of all ages within a given time frame and teach them about the most potential resource of the world, the Web.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Kolkata being the only city in the country to go full wifi in next one year, many teenagers and kids will be using the Internet in near future. So, educating them about the Web is a necessity. Keeping this in mind, we came up with the One Web, an initiative to touch maximum lives in 3 months. The planning was driven by&nbsp;</span><a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/rano1396/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ranodeep&nbsp;Saha</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, along with Co-organizers&nbsp;</span><a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/Technoayan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ayan Choudhury</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/shahidfarooqui/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shahid Ali Farooqui</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And the blueprint got ready in just seven days. The project finally got off to a flying start on 3rd of July, 2016.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A rain marred Sunday morning saw 23 volunteers engaging themselves to impart training on web literacy to some 153 underprivileged children at a southbound back alley near Topsia. It went on for 2 hours.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">â€ª </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2nd event took place on 17th July 2016 at Kailash Vidyamandir near Chetla. Some 129 students participated with great enthusiasm. The idea is to hold one event on every alternate Sunday, for three consecutive months. So, just hold your breath!! There are a lot more in store to come up in next 6-7 Sundays.</span></p>
