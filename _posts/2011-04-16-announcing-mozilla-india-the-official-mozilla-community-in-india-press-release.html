<strong>Announcing Mozilla India: the official Mozilla Community in India<br />

<strong>Hyderabad, April 16 2011:</strong> The members of the Mozilla user groups across the country, Mozilla contributors, users of popular Mozilla products: Firefox and Thunderbird, are coming together as the officially sponsored Mozilla community in India - Mozilla India. Today marks the release of the official channel for the community&rsquo;s initiatives - the official community website - MozillaIndia.org.</p>
<p>The objectives of the community are to promote the open web and the open ecosystem, through Mozilla and the Mozilla perspective to them in India. The community aims to reach out to end users and contributors to guide them about Mozilla projects and ease up the process of contributing to Mozilla&rsquo;s open source projects.<br />
The community will also create awareness for the Mozilla Mission and spread across the domain spectrum in India such as educational institutions, government organisations, corporations, and individuals.</p>
<p>Mozilla India will do these promotions by organizing awareness programs, events, localising projects in Indic languages, offering help, support and guidance in promotion of the Mozilla vision of the open web.</p>
<p>The community is spearheaded by open source enthusiasts and Mozilla aficionados from across India and the core group is formed of three people: Abhishek Nagar (a Drupal and Mozilla fan boy from Haldwani), Kinshuk Sunil (an open source enthusiasts, Mozilla Firefox and LibreOffice contributor), and Vineel Reddy Pindi (the heart of the community, a Mozilla Representative).</p>
<p>The community&rsquo;s first initiatives are regional Firefox 4 launch parties, which not only emphasise on the improvements in the browser, but also how Mozilla, Firefox, and the community are taking the open web forward. Launch parties are being organised in 22 cities during April 15th and 16th, with parties in some cities already over, including Delhi.</p>
<p>The next initiative is the community&rsquo;s official website - MozillaIndia.org, which will serve as the platform for all activities of the community. The website is being released with the launch parties. Over the coming few weeks, Mozilla India will also announce a series of design challenges and projects for the community in India to engage with. Information about these will be available on MozillaIndia.org. The initiatives of the community are open to all citizens of India irrespective of their careers or functional domains. Anyone who cares about the Internet or is influenced by the web is welcome to be a member of the community, be it Students, Film makers, photographers, teachers, developers, media, lawyers, doctors, designers, open source enthusiasts and so on.</p>
