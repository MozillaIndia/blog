<li><span class="author-g-duukj078chev9f1c">This session was opened by one of participants, Ravi Teja (wow /). We were really honoured to have such awesome audience with us. He gave the basic knowledge of git to everyone.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span class="author-g-duukj078chev9f1c">Since git is the most important part of such contributions, we set up a <a href="https://github.com/gurumukhi/MarketplaceDay/">sample repository</a> and asked everyone to make changes and submit pull requests. Many people got conflicts, and that was what we had it. So they learn about these things. We got 10 PRs on this repo, few of which had conflicts, which were resolved by participants themselves and finally merged. This was the another challenging part of the event where participants were finding it very touch to deal with the syncing remote branch with upstream branch.</span></li>
