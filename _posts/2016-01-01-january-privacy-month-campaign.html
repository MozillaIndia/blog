<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;Happy New Year to all !</strong></p>
<p>This year 2016 starts with an important campaign for online Privacy. This January we are celebrating the Online Privacy Month. It's a campaign to make users and makers of the web care, learn, teach and share about Online Privacy.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn and share your thoughts about&nbsp;current trends and future issues for privacy and the steps we we can take today against privacy infringements.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy Month is the first of many steps we'll be taking this year in an effort to empower the users of the web&nbsp;to protect their privacy and control their digital footprint.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/India/task_force/Policy_and_Advocacy/January_Privacy_Month_Campaign">January Privacy Month Campaign</a></strong> is a community led campaign/initiative to celebrate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Privacy_Day">International Data Privacy Day</a>. The campaign was originated by Mozilla India and is intended to be a global campaign. Communities from all over the world can participate. Please see below for the ways you can get involved. Volunteers are welcome to help with online posts, events, teaching kits and other resources, localization, and more.</p>

<p>The Campaign has 2 parts:</p>
