<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a repost from </span><a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/community"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://blog.mozilla.org/community</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> blog.</span></em></p>
<p>All around the world, passionate Mozillians are working to move Mozilla&rsquo;s mission forward. But if you asked five different Mozillians what the mission is, you might get seven different answers.</p>
<p>At the end of last year, Mozilla&rsquo;s CEO, Chris Beard presented a clear articulation of Mozilla&rsquo;s mission, vision, role and how our products will help us get there in the next five years. The goal of this Strategic Narrative is to create for all of Mozilla, a concise, shared understanding of our goals that we can use to be more empowered as individuals to make decisions, and identify opportunities to move Mozilla forward.</p>
<p>In order for Mozilla to achieve it&rsquo;s mission we cannot work alone. We need all of the thousands of Mozillians around the world aligned behind this, so that we can do incredible things at a pace and with a voice that is louder than ever before.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is why one of the Participation Team&rsquo;s six </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1A3Ma9gNawAYYGbYC2bUW0wUwcpHuvyMiZvHNiMLriw0/edit#slide=id.gdaa7a0bd0_1_0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">strategic initiatives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the first half of this year is to spread this narrative to as many Mozillians as possible so that in 2016 we can have our largest impact yet. We will also be creating a follow-up post that will do a deep dive specifically on the Participation Team strategy for 2016.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://blogmozillaindiaorg.wpengine.mcws.mozilla.community/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2015-12-18-at-2.02.07-PM-600x335.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1586" src="https://blogmozillaindiaorg.wpengine.mcws.mozilla.community/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2015-12-18-at-2.02.07-PM-600x335-600x335.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2015-12-18-at-2.02.07-PM-600x335" width="600" height="335" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding this strategy will be crucial for anyone looking to make an impact at Mozilla this year, as it will determine what we advocate for, how we focus our resources, and which projects we focus on for 2016. </span></p>
<p>As the year kicks off we will dive more deeply into this strategy and share more details of how the various teams and projects around Mozilla are working to further these goals.</p>
<p>The immediate call to action is to think about this in the context of your work and about how you will contribute to Mozilla next year this helps shape your innovations, your ambitions and your impact for 2016.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We hope you will join the conversation and share your questions, comments, and plans for what you will do to drive the strategic narrative forward in 2016 on discourse </span><a href="https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/mozillas-strategic-narrative-2016/6397"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or share your thoughts on Twitter with the hashtag #Mozilla2016Strategy.</span></p>
