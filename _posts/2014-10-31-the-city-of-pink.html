<p>We got the actual flavours of Rajasthan once <a href="http://blogmozillaindiaorg.wpengine.mcws.mozilla.community/1046">FirefoxOSBus</a> reached the city of pink, Jaipur. Travelling for 7 hours from Udaipur, the mozbus finally reached Jaipur. A warm Rajasthani style welcome was waiting for us. Regional coordinators Prachi Jain and Varun Kaushik were really friendly and they took every effort to make it perfect.</p>
<p>Mozbus&rsquo;s first visit was at Nahargarh&rsquo;s Fort, Jaipur. The gorgeous fort attracted each one of us. Even the scorching heat didn&rsquo;t stop us from spreading the awesomeness of firefoxOs. We interacted with tourists and local people and gave them a small demonstration on firefoxOs device. The word of Womoz were spread among the woman crowd. Finally we clicked selfies and left Nahargarh&rsquo;s Fort.</p>

<p>Soon after finishing our lunch we went to World Trade Park(WTP), Jaipur. We managed to seek through the official permissions for our foxy. Foxy was seen hopping inside the mall along with kids. Kids were over enthusiastic to click pics with our dearest foxy. Spending some quality time inside the mall we left for dinner followed by some rest.</p>

<p>The next day morning we planned to hop around Amer Fort, Jaipur. This is one of the most famous forts of Jaipur covering over 16kms of area. We interacted with tourists about our mission in the firefoxOs bus. Soon after this, it was time for us to bid Jaipur goodbye. We left the pink city in its pink form and headed towards our final destination, Delhi.</p>
