<p>Mozilla India is organising the &lsquo;Mozilla&nbsp;India Meetup 2016&rsquo; during&nbsp;<span class="gmail-aBn" tabindex="0"><span class="gmail-aQJ">August 26 - 28, 2016</span></span>&nbsp;at Pune.</p>
<p>Mozilla India Meetup 2016 is a pan India community meetup which is being&nbsp;organised to bring together the potential, active and committed&nbsp;contributors across India to align the community with the goals and&nbsp;strategies of Mozilla. This meetup is an opportunity to work with the people and<br />
groups in designing the policies and commitments which would&nbsp;benefit Mozilla India in future. This gathering is also seen as a great&nbsp;platform to get all the participants on the same page as to where we&rsquo;re&nbsp;heading.</p>
<p>To manage the selection process, we have created a lightweight application form&nbsp;to have you indicate both your availability and&nbsp;commitment. Before you fill this out, please make sure that&nbsp;you are:</p>

<li>Able to commit substantial effort to Mozilla&rsquo;s mission/work in the next One year following from August 2016.</li>
