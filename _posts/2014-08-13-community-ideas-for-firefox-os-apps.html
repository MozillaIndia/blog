<p>With Firefox OS poised to coming to India very soon, we have a lot of new opportunities for developers from all around the nation to develop Mobile applications for Firefox OS.</p>
<p>With the Indian launch nearing reality, many Mozillians are contributing to the project in terms of Hackathons, teaching app development, getting involved with maker parties, teaching Appmaker and lot of other things.</p>
<p>To help application developers in developing open web apps, we would like to create a consolidated pool of app ideas in the Google form shared below, the replies to these are also open and can be found at the link shared below.</p>
