<p><strong> To spread the all new Firefox in India, Mozilla India community is planning for a coordinated pan-India campaign, <b>backed by several exciting new product features. The campaign would run from June 1st week - July 2nd week.<br />
</b></strong><br />
To celebrate the latest Firefox update we are creating a campaign that helps fans of Firefox invite the people in their networks to download Firefox. We are creating unique, sharable pieces of content that are humorous, insightful and topical to get the conversation started.<b></b></p>
<p><a href="https://foxyeah.mozilla.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1390" src="https://blogmozillaindiaorg.wpengine.mcws.mozilla.community/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/05/Firefox-latte-600x600.jpg" alt="Firefox latte" width="600" height="600" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What are we saying?</strong><br />
Firefox is a non-profit browser that was created by thousands of volunteers who believe the Internet should be free and open to everyone. Firefox is built for people, not for profit. We don&rsquo;t believe in tracking and selling people&rsquo;s data. Firefox believes in creating a safe, open and customizable way to experience the web. Our dedication to privacy is the reason we were voted the most trustworthy Internet company.<b></b></p>
<p><strong>Why are we asking you?</strong><br />
You are a passionate member of the Mozilla community. You tell people all the time about how amazing Firefox is and you probably have some super creative thoughts on how other people could tell their families and friends to download Firefox too. Your content might be shared 100 times or 100,000 times. We can&rsquo;t know. We can only hope.<strong><b><br />
