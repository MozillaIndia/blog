<p>After travelling miles &nbsp;<a title="firefoxOSbus" href="http://http://blogmozillaindiaorg.wpengine.mcws.mozilla.community/1046">FirefoxOSbus</a>&nbsp;finally reached Goa. It was one of the most beautiful places that were involved in our travel plan. The warm welcome by the regional coordinator Jonathan Pereira made us feel like home. He guided the bus to Don Bosco College of Engineering, our first destination in Goa. Enthusiastic students were eagerly waiting for the mozbus. The students gathered in the conference hall and they were all ready for the event. The most exciting part was the presence of foxy in the campus. Students were super excited to see foxy. After the awesome response from the students we planned for an exciting contest. The name allotted to the contest was &ldquo;selfie with foxy&rdquo;. We asked all the students to click selfies with foxy and then upload it in social media networks. To much of our surprise we had nearly 70 posts within an hour. It was really amazing to see such enthusiasm from the students.</p>

ENTIRE CREW</p>
<p>After this awesome response firefoxOsbus was set for another visit. We went to Shree Rameshwar college of Engineering, Goa. The location of the college itself was exciting. We had a great time with all the students and the teachers. We demonstrated firefoxOs devices and spread a word about Mozilla and different ways to contribute. Later, students were given swags for the best selfies that they had posted in twitter and facebook.</p>

<p>After spending awesome time with the students we were tired enough for some refreshments. What can be the best refreshment in Goa other than spending some quality time in the sea followed by seafood dinner.</p>

<p>Our very own Army head Vineel Anna was all set to bid us good bye and leave for Mozfest London. With a heavy heart we signed off from Goa and headed towards Pune, our next destination. Anna was really missed by mozbus crew but we marched forward with a promise that we will make him proud of his commanders.</p>
