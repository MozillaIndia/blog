<p>This is a team that works with pixels mostly in front of screens sitting in places around connected via internet. We just thought to sit in a room to find out what will happen.</p>
<h2>Walking into the unknown</h2>
<p>Getting work done was never an issue, so identifying the challenges was the point of meeting. It took half a day to get through those.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogmozillaindiaorg.wpengine.mcws.mozilla.community/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/05/IMG_8570.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1305" src="https://blogmozillaindiaorg.wpengine.mcws.mozilla.community/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/05/IMG_8570.jpg" alt="IMG_8570" width="398" height="242" /></a></p>
<p>Issues identified involves both general and specific ones, ranging from loss in translation, sticking to brand guidelines and more.</p>
<h2>Navigating the Unknown</h2>
<p>Navigating the unknown paths without a guide or reference is adventurous, but time consuming, which we don&rsquo;t have, so we invited the Local community and shared the issues to get feedback it was a success so far. <strong>Thank you Mozilla Bengaluru.</strong></p>
<p>Here is what happened in two days under 2 minutes, thanks Anush for the video.</p>
