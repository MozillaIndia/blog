<p>On <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">November 10</span></span>, Firefox will celebrate 10 years of being your trusted partner in the online world. Firefox is the only non-profit, non-corporate, non-compromised browser out there, and we want Web users to everywhere know they have an independent choice.</p>
<p>We're looking for help in spreading the word so we've created a guide on how to participate <a title="Firefox 10 Community Participation Website " href="http://firefox10.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">firefox10.org</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogmozillaindiaorg.wpengine.mcws.mozilla.community/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2014/11/Help-us-to-celebrate-Firefox-10th-anniversary1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1139 size-full" src="https://blogmozillaindiaorg.wpengine.mcws.mozilla.community/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2014/11/Help-us-to-celebrate-Firefox-10th-anniversary1.jpg" alt="" width="851" height="351" /></a></p>
<p>Has limited time? &nbsp;Here are the two priorities.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Zero time</strong> - Sign up for the Firefox Thunderclap: Share the message that you - along with thousands of people around the world - choose <span id="714257ca-fb38-4cee-8413-8a26de9ef616" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"><span id="b231031e-d83d-4063-807f-14a89f16b1f7" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"><span id="5c4dcaa3-9d1d-4a63-84fa-b5d279d97e4b" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"><span id="49f724ba-2c19-4ba5-b971-492c0b7edcb2" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">independent</span></span></span></span>.<br />
<a title="Choose Independent Thunderclap Campaign" href="http://mzl.la/ppfx10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sign Up Now!<br />
</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>A little more time</strong> - Take a picture and share it: Put on Firefox gear, select a landmark in your city, print out this sign (link to sign), rally your friends and family, take a photo, and share it across your social networks. Make sure to caption it with: Firefox is my independent choice in (select city). #ChooseIndependent, #fx10<br />
We have localized the above graphics to Hindi. You can find the <a title="Choose Independent Hindi Front side" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9I8V40G7rztQzY5c25SX3JZaHM/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">front side</a> and the <a title="Choose Independent Hindi Back side" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9I8V40G7rzteDF5Q3pUR3g0WUE/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">back side </a>of the graphic and use it in Hindi.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both actions will show the breadth and reach of Mozillians!</p>
<p dir="ltr">Stay tuned for more details on <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">November 10th</span></span> - including how to participate in launch activities locally and from afar.</p>
<p><b>Let's light this fire!</b></p>
