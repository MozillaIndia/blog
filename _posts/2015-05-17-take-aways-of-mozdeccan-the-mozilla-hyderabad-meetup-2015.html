Akshay Tiwari and Harsha Bandaru, continued the discussion by sharing the statistics of </span><span class="author-p-25378">the community with everyone. This was a very proud moment for all of us. Seeing the achievement and awesome work done by the awesome community members in last year was indeed the most pleasant feeling indeed.
