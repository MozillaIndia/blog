<p><strong>To spread Localized Firefox in India, Mozilla Hindi Localization community is planning for a coordinated pan-India campaign. The campaign would run from 2nd October to 1st November.</strong></p>
<p>Why 2nd October: 2nd October is birthday of our Father our Nation, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mahatma Gandhi</a>&nbsp; and we celebrate this day as Gandhi Jayanti.<br />
<i>"Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, but above all for achieving Swaraj or self-rule."</i></p>
<p>To show users that Firefox is available in their language we are creating a campaign that helps fans of Firefox invite the people in their networks to download Firefox. We are creating unique, shareable pieces of content that are humorous, insightful and topical to get the conversation and activities started.</p>

<p><strong>What are we saying?</strong></p>
<p>Firefox is a non-profit browser that was created by thousands of volunteers who believe the Internet should be free and open to everyone. Firefox is built for people, not for profit. We don&rsquo;t believe in tracking and selling people&rsquo;s data. Firefox believes in creating a safe, open and customizable way to experience the web. Our dedication to privacy is the reason we were voted the most trustworthy Internet company.</p>
<p><strong>Why are we asking you?</strong></p>
