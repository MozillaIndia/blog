<p>Yet another campaign!! And excitement galore.</p>
<p>So hold your breath. Here comes the exciting news for all the Mozillians. With an aim to increase Firefox nightly usage in India, we&rsquo;re bringing in a new campaign called &ldquo;<a href="https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/2017/03/30/guest-post-india-uses-firefox-nightly-a-campaign-especially-for-india/">India uses Firefox Nightly</a>&ldquo;.</p>
<p>Have you tried <a href="https://nightly.mozilla.org">Firefox Nightly</a> yet, download it now and check yourself. Very few people in India actually know about Firefox Nightly. So, we&rsquo;ve taken an initiative to run a pilot campaign for Firefox Nightly throughout India just to make our Mozilla India community aware and educate on the usefulness of this <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/e/india-uses-firefox-nightly/">campaign</a>.</p>
<p>Forget not, India has a fairly big Mozilla community comprising of dedicated students, developers and evangelists who are really passionate about Mozilla. For next two months, starting from May probably, we&rsquo;ll hold 15 different events in 15 different cities. All the events will be coordinated and organized by the local Mozilla community.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1802 aligncenter" src="./wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IndiaUsesNightlySticker-600x600-2-252x252.png" alt="" width="252" height="252" /></p>
<p>We invite students, community members, developers, open source evangelists to spread the word through social media using Hashtag: #INUsesFxNightly and simultaneously run this campaign successfully. As part of the online campaign, the propagation should be made through social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram), blogs, promotional snippets, email, mailing list, website news items etc. For offline activities, any community member or open source enthusiast can host an event in their area or join any nearby event to help organizers. The event can be held at a startup company, school, universities, community centres, home, caf&eacute;s.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Firefox Nightly is an attempt to decide what the future of Firefox will be for hundreds of millions of people. Having a healthy and strong technical community using and testing Nightly is a great way to easily get involved in Mozilla by providing a constant feedback loop to developers. Here Mozillians will get ample scope to test lots of pre-release features.</p>
<p>So, it needs a lot of enthusiasm and courage to take the challenge of making 1000 Nightly installed, which is our goal. We want a total of 30 Mozillians (2 per event) to take charge of 15 events ensuring around 500 attendees. We need many core campaign volunteers who will help us to run this initiative smoothly.
