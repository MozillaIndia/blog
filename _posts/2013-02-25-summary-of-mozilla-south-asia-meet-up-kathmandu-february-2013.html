<p><span style="font-size: small;">The first ever <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Community/South-Asia/Inter-Community-Meetup-2013" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mozilla South Asia community meet-up</a> took place at beautiful Kathmandu, Nepal on 22-24<sup>th</sup> February 2013, with the coordination from Mozilla Nepal regional community. The meet-up brought together community leaders from the South Asia, including Gen Kanai, Director of Asia Community Engagement<span style="font-size: small;"> at</span> Mozilla to meet for 3 days of presentations, breakout sessions and discussions to plan the implementation of the Mozilla South Asia community road map for 2013 and ensure that the regional community is aligned with greater engagement efforts across the Mozilla organization. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: small;">Background:<br />
South Asia is a unique region with diverse cultures and with an immensely growing Mozilla community presence. The community members from the region were already cross-collaborating on projects like localization, community building, webmaker etc. Some of <span style="font-size: small;">t</span>he challenges faced by the South Asia regional community <span style="font-size: small;">we</span>re similar and thus the scope of working together is greater. There is this huge potential from the rapidly growing community that can grow positively if guided in right direction. Another major fact is the millions of internet users and the growing mass mobile market which makes the South Asia region a land of possibilities. This also makes it necessary for creating awareness on the open web and how it can impact in day to day life.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/e/mozilla-south-asia-2013/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-evlze-3LafA/UV_2gx5HXBI/AAAAAAAAQWg/wfUB_opuWdA/w431-h428-p-o/MozillaSA13.jpg" /></a><br />
<span style="font-size: small;">The idea of the south asia meet-up came up during the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/MozCampAsia2012" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MozCamp Asia Singapore</a>. From the very beginning, we kept the scope of the event around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asian_Association_for_Regional_Cooperation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAARC</a> nations, to keep the event more focused for a specific region and avoid any blurred-boundary conditions. The <span style="font-size: small;">objective of the </span>three day meet <span style="font-size: small;">wa</span>s to help nurture, plan and motivate the regional communities to collaborate, develop and grow.</span></p>
<p>The aim of the workshop was to enable Mozilla communities in the South Asia region to share and learn from each other's experience working on the Mozilla Project, improve collaboration in the future, and work on specific tasks.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">The participating community members include from the regions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.mozillabd.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-size: small;">Bangladesh</span></a></li>
<li><a href="http://mozillaindia.org/"><span style="font-size: small;">India</span></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/MozillaNepal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-size: small;">Nepal</span></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/MozPk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-size: small;">Pakistan</span></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.mozilla.lk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-size: small;">Sri Lanka</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Venue:</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-size: small;">There were several reasons for choosing Kathmandu, Nepal as the venue.<br />
* The Mozilla community in Nepal is new and actively growing. One of the challenge they were facing was letting people know the larger picture of the local community that it is part of the global community of Mozilla. Technology groups or people in Nepal did not take Mozilla regional community seriously and thought the team was acting on their own with out the cooperation of Mozilla.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: small;">* As part of SAARC understanding there is a visa on arrival for other SAARC nation citizens<span style="font-size: small;"> and</span> Indians don't required a visa to travel to Nepal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">We saw this meet-up as an opportunity to: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: small;">Improve and grow Mozilla presence in Nepal </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;">Introduce Mozilla Nepal regional community and give a strong message that Mozilla is there to support.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;">Participate in a public event to introduce Mozilla mission, its projects and how to get-involve. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;">Connect to interested contributors/ partners from regions in and around Kathmandu, Nepal.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">And of-course to have this milestone meet-up at the beautiful Kathmandu Valley.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Day <span style="font-size: small;">0</span>:</strong></span><br />
On Friday evening we had a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hardfire/8509649739/in/set-72157632861645073" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">informal gathering</a> to get to know each other(ice-breaking session). Later we had traditional Nepali style dinner with<span style="font-size: small;"> a live</span> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hardfire/8510730162/in/set-72157632861645073/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">traditional dance</a> show.Before going to sleep everyone was given a brief about what the next two days would be like and what to expect from the meet-up.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Day <span style="font-size: small;">1</span>:</strong></span><br />
Day <span style="font-size: small;">1</span> had two main things: 1. Kick staring the meet-up in the morning and 2. Participate at the public event, '<a href="http://www.osmnepal.org/open-data-day-nepal-2013/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Data Day Nepal</a>' in the afternoon.<br />

The day started with everyone joining for the group breakfast, Gen joined us at this time. It was amazing that <span style="font-size: small;">m</span>ost of us were meeting each other for the first time, even though it was like we know each other for a long time in the online world.</p>
<p>The official meeting started with introductions and each member answering 3 questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: small;">Who am I? </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;">What do I do in Mozilla? </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;">What am I planning to do in 2013 for Mozilla?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">The introduction session was followed by individuals mentioning about what are the things working for them/their regional community and what are not. The notes from this session can be found <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/Mozilla-SAARCamp-2012-ToDo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</span></p>
<p>After lunch, we went to participate <span style="font-size: small;">at</span> the public event, <a href="http://www.osmnepal.org/open-data-day-nepal-2013/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Data Day</a>. We travelled in a vintage VW bus. At the event we introduced various Mozilla projects to the audience. The Firefox OS topic had the most follow-up questions and many people were excited to see the test phones running Firefox OS. Rest of the evening we continued with brainstorming on ways to collaborate and improve the engagement efforts in the local communities.<br />

<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Day <span style="font-size: small;">2</span>:</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Day <span style="font-size: small;">2</span> was focused mainly on working on getting solutions to the problems and challenges that were discussed during the past two days and summarize the meet-up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><img alt="" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8516/8515636537_a169f246ca_b.jpg" /><img alt="" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8096/8515634847_5164b04248_b.jpg" /></strong></span><br />
<span style="font-size: small;"><em>Left: Sri Lanka Team, Right: Nepal Team</em></span></span></p>
<p>We divided into teams regional community wise and made a list of whats working and whats not working. Several important issues and concerns were raised during the <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/Mozilla-SAARCamp-2012-Notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discussion</a>.<br />
<img title="Bangladesh Team " alt="" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8105/8516751850_e3c424d28a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" /></p>
<p><img title=" " alt="" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8092/8515635959_a5fb24a1db_b.jpg" /></p>
<p><em></em><span style="font-size: small;">To tackle the things project area wise, we came-up with the proposal of having task force teams. Each task force team is responsible for a project area and has a set of contributors and mentors with-in it. Everyone at the meet-up were asked to self-assign a task so that each one of us has some goal to work towards and target to achieve. Here is the list of the <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/SAARC-Responsibilities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Task Force team</a> formed at the meet-up. Once tasks force teams were formed, each task force team had their part of the independent discussion and chalked out tentative road map for the coming few months. This discussion was productive and was a major outcome of the event. A <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Community/South-Asia/Task_Force" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wiki page</a> is created to maintain a list of contributors and document the Task Force Team activities<span style="font-size: small;">.</span> </span></p>

<span style="font-size: small;">As this was the first ever meet<span style="font-size: small;">-</span>up, there is a large room for improvement and to make best use of such gatherings. Overall the meet-up was a great success and productive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">This meet-up would have not possible without the efforts of the Mozilla Nepal community and their dedication to make it happen. Also great thanks to everyone who have taken time to participate <span style="font-size: small;">at the meet-up and added value to it</span>.&nbsp;</span>Thank you William Quiviger, Michelle Thorne(hope to have you next time!) and Soumya Deb for coordinating with the event. <span style="font-size: small;">Many thanks to <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/gen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gen Kanai</a></span><span style="font-size: small;"> for his continuous support to the community initiatives in the region. A note to community members from Asia: Gen Kanai is here to support us. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Personally the Mozilla South Asia meet up and <span style="font-size: small;">Kathmandu trip</span> will remain special to me. Learned a lot from th<span style="font-size: small;">e<span style="font-size: small;"> neighbour community</span>.&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">One thing that</span> surpris<span style="font-size: small;">ed</span> me at Kathmandu was, the whole city goes to sleep by 9.00 PM, after that time all the roads look deserted. They also wake-up very early, the community members from Nepal use to attend their college, write their assignments and join us for <span style="font-size: small;">b</span>reakfast!!</span> <span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Also, </span>It was the first time that I visited a country where no visa/ documentation is required, wish the <a href="https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/299145_481877045213159_485118626_n.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whole world</a> <span style="font-size: small;">i</span>s this <span style="font-size: small;">free</span> to travel. </span></p>
<p>The meet-up opened several oppertunities and we are thrilled to work together upon them in the coming days. Stay tuned for more action!</p>
