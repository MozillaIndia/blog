<p>Maker Party Pune is being held on the 6th of September 2014. The executive director of Mozilla Foundation, Mark Surman, is going to be personally present for this event. This event is an attempt to map and empower a community of educators and creative people who share a passion to innovate, evolve and change the learning landscape.</p>
<p>The event has a simple format called 'Hive Pop-up', it's like a science fair, where facilitators are sharing cutting edge technologies, teach something new in a engaging way. This event is a platform to connect diverse organizations with learners and encourage connected learning.</p>
<p>We are asking organizations to host a learning station, i.e. a simple table-top activity,&nbsp; based on their programs/ background, by planning hands-on activity that is easily understandable by any age group/ skill level.</p>
<p>The audience age group would be *13+ and above*, the attempt to target tweens, teens and adults is, we think it is the right time to tap their interest and get the '<span class="il">Maker</span>' thinking right from the young age than being a 'consumer'. i.e. Encourage the youth to change from 'technology/web consumers' to 'technology/web <span class="il">makers</span>'.</p>
