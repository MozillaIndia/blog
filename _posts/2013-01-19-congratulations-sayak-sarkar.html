<div>If you have heard about the community members from Pune, India, you might have also heard about the amazing Mozilla Summer Code Party events that took place in the region. Sayak Sarkar is one of the key persons behind them.<br />

<p><a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/sayak_bugsmith/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sayak</a> is an amazing <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mozilla rep</a> from India and <a href="https://webmaker.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Webmaker</a> star performer, teaching webmaking to students. Sayak has worked on hosting several small and big webmaker events. Not just webmaker, Sayak played a major role in taking forward the Pune community with the help of other reps from the region.
</div>
<div>In September 2012, Sayak, along with other reps initiated the idea of having a grand finale event for <a href="https://webmaker.org/en-US/events/about/summer_campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mozilla Summer Code Party </a>at Pune, celebrating the success of MozParty events across the country. The event named '<a href="http://mozillaindia.org/node/664">Mozilla Carnival</a>' was a <a href="http://mozillaindia.org/node/674">huge success</a> with amazing response. After this event Mozilla India received several requests from colleges across the county to host similar event in their region. We started using Mozilla Carnival event format and almost formalized it in a way for events hosted by Mozilla India regional community.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Because of Sayak's exemplary <a href="http://mozillawebmaker.tumblr.com/post/32320325589/amazing-mentors-educators-zainab-oni-hivenyc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contributions</a> to Mozilla's Webmaker community, he has been offered an Internship with Mozilla. Sayak will be working directly with the Mozilla's Global events team and help build tools and resources for the project. At the same time he will be working on creating tools and documentation for Mozilla Reps to be able to contribute to Webmaker.</div>

<p>I first met Sayak while he was a event coordinator at <a href="http://gnunify.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GNUnify'12</a>, he also attended <a href="http://mozillaindia.org/blog/community-india-meetup-summary-next-steps">Community India meetup</a> which was held at the same time. He made sure the meetup went smooth and constantly asked us if we need help with anything. Later he joined Mozilla Reps program.</p>
<p>Although Sayak's recognition is purely because of his contributions, I am happy to be indirectly involved through my Mozilla Reps Mentor role and its a pleasure working with him. Very proud of you Sayak! Keep up the great work and all the best for your future.</p>
