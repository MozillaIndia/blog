<p>After the grand success of the <a title="Announcement of First Mozilla Geolocation Pilot" href="http://blogmozillaindiaorg.wpengine.mcws.mozilla.community/889" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first experimental Pilot</a>, the Mozilla Geolocation team is excited to run <em>another</em> pilot in India.</p>
<p>Yes, we've achieved almost 10x the metrics we had approximated in terms of coverage, peaked the global contribution to 10x during the sprint and sustained a considerable regular contribution to the project (3x) even after the sprint was over - <a title="Mozilla Location Services &ndash; A story of intentionality and growth" href="http://pierros.papadeas.gr/?p=377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as Pierro's neatly summed it up</a>.</p>
<p>A big hug &amp; thank you to all who participated... and now, let's take the opportunity of the second pilot &amp; break our own past record!</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #808080;">Bytheway, if you are one of the top-contributor of the first pilot, but haven't yet received the gift power-bank yet - it's because the trouble with shipping electronics in India without a vendor license. We'll be handing out all the gifts at the MozCamp Beta India; if you're not attending in person, then it will be sent to you via a ReMo from your region.</span></p></blockquote>
<h2>Event Details</h2>
<p>In order to improvise from our last pilot, we've figured that there's no need for it to be an offline, single venue event. This time we're going with pan-India scope right from the beginning &amp; kicking-off with a virtual event (Video Conference), for anyone to join in, from anywhere in India.</p>
<p>The kick off event has been scheduled at 2:00PM IST on 8th June, 2014. Join us over Vidyo at <a href="http://mzl.la/remo-vidyo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">http://mzl.la/remo-vidyo</a>.</p>
<p>Once kicked off, y'all will have exactly one week (ending on 15th June, 2014 at 5:30PM IST) to scout all over India with MozStumbler. But make sure to register yourselves as a Geolocation scout (detailed later; registering is important).</p>
<h2>Remote Sites</h2>
<p>As the event will be kicked off with a virtual event, we've primarily selected a few remote sites where we'll be having teams who will be joining us over the video conference. Here's the list of locations we have so far:</p>
