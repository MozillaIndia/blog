<p>The second Mozilla South Asia meetup happened at Kolkata, the cultural capital of India during January 25-26. This meetup brought together community leaders from Nepal, Sri Lanka, India and remote participation from Bangladesh and Pakistan community, including staff from Japan, France and Germany to meet for 2 days of presentations, breakout sessions and discussions. Also the idea is to ensure that the regional community are aligned with greater engagement efforts across the Mozilla organization.</p>

<li>What was your biggest challenge in 2013?</li>
<li>What is your big goal for 2014?</li>
<li>Where can we follow/ learn more about you?</li>
</ol>
<p>Adding to this, <a href="https://twitter.com/gen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gen Kanai </a>encouraged regional communities to make a report by each to reflect upon community accomplishment's, milestones, challenges, community metrics from 2013 and share the story with the global community.

<p>The second half of the day we did SWOT analysis. The aim of the workshop is to have a deeper understanding of the regional community strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. It was one intense session which involved a lot of discussion.</p>
