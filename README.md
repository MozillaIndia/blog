# blog #

This is a meta-repository to collaborate on the new version of [Mozilla India blog](https://blog.mozillaindia.org).

## Background ##

The community blog was a wordpress blog maintained by Mozilla Community Web Services and part of a wordpress multi-site installation. As such wordpress does not have a discussion forum for reporting issues or suggesting ideas. Neither does wordpress allow open contributions. Therefore the community felt a need to move the blog to a modern framework which can be maintained on a platform like github. [Thus the content was migrated](https://asd.learnlearn.in/migrating-wordpress-to-jekyll/). The migration will be complete when the URL blog.mozillaindia.org is served from this code base.

## Contributing ##

You can use the [issues](https://github.com/MozillaIndia/blog/issues) on this repository to suggest content ideas, report bugs, or anything that comes to your mind regarding the blog.

## Code of Conduct ##

Mozilla's [Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/about/governance/policies/participation/) apply to this and all other spaces where Mozillians interact.
